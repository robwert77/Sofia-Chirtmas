# Christmas Collage Webapp

This is a single-page webapp with a holiday collage layout.

## Customize the text

Edit the text in `script.js` inside the `config` object.

## Add your photos

1) Put your images in `assets/photos/`.
2) Update the `photos` array in `script.js` with the filenames and captions.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser. For best results, use a local web server so images load reliably.
